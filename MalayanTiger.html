                  <h2> Malayan Tiger: A National Symbol of Malaysia </h2>

                  <!-- main -->
                   <p>The Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) is a critically endangered subspecies of tiger found primarily in the Malay Peninsula. It is one of the smallest subspecies of tiger, but its significance to Malaysia goes far beyond its size. The Malayan tiger holds deep cultural, historical, and ecological importance, symbolizing both national pride and the urgent need for wildlife conservation in the country.</p>

                  <!-- main -->
                   <p>The Malayan tiger was only recognized as a separate subspecies in 2004, distinguishing it from the Indochinese tiger. They inhabit the dense tropical rainforests of Malaysia, relying on the vast and humid lowland forests and mountain ranges for cover and prey. These forests provide a habitat rich in biodiversity, where the tiger is at the top of the food chain. Unfortunately, deforestation and habitat fragmentation have drastically reduced their natural range, leaving only a few remaining populations in areas like the Taman Negara National Park and the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex.</p>

                  <h2> Historical and Cultural Significance </h2>
              </header>
              <main>
                  <!-- main -->
                   <p>The Malayan tiger is deeply intertwined with Malaysia's cultural heritage and identity. Historically, the tiger has been a symbol of strength, courage, and leadership in Malay folklore. Warriors in ancient Malaysia were often likened to tigers, signifying their bravery and prowess in battle.

                    In modern Malaysia, the tiger is more than just a symbol of power—it is a national emblem. The tiger is featured prominently on Malaysia's coat of arms, representing the strength and courage of the Malaysian people. The two tigers standing guard beside the national shield also symbolize the protection and defense of the country's sovereignty and people. It’s a figure that inspires respect and is a point of national pride.
                    
                    Beyond its symbolic meaning, the Malayan tiger has also played a significant role in shaping the natural balance of Malaysia's ecosystems. As an apex predator, the tiger helps control populations of herbivores like deer and wild boar, maintaining the health and stability of the forests. This delicate balance is crucial for the biodiversity and sustainability of Malaysia’s unique ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>AnimalWiki features detailed profiles of thousands of animal species. From mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians to insects, marine life, and everything in between, each profile includes essential information such as scientific classification, physical characteristics, habitat, diet, and behavioral traits. We also cover fascinating facts that make each species unique, allowing readers to discover the intricate details of how animals survive, thrive, and adapt to their environments.

                    Beyond individual species, we explore broader topics that touch on the wonders of animal life:
                     
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small but Mighty:</strong> The Malayan tiger is smaller than most other tiger subspecies, with males weighing between 100-120 kg (220-265 lbs) and females slightly smaller. However, it is still a powerful and efficient predator.</li>
                        <li><strong>Territorial Animals:</strong> Malayan tigers are solitary creatures, and they fiercely defend their territories, which can span hundreds of square kilometers, depending on the availability of prey and habitat quality.</li>
                        <li> <strong>In Critical Danger:</strong> The Malayan tiger is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Estimates suggest that fewer than 150 tigers remain in the wild due to poaching and habitat loss, primarily driven by illegal logging and agricultural expansion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conservation Efforts:</strong> Numerous organizations, including the Malaysian government, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and local conservation groups, are working tirelessly to protect this species. The Malayan tiger is a key focus in Malaysia’s national conservation strategies, and initiatives like the Tiger Action Plan aim to double the wild population through anti-poaching patrols, habitat restoration, and public awareness campaigns.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>A National Mascot:</strong> The Malayan tiger has been the official mascot of many important Malaysian events, including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games, further solidifying its status as a beloved national symbol.</p></li>
