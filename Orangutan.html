                   <p>The <strong>orangutan</strong> <em>(Pongo pygmaeus)</em>, known as the "man of the forest" in Malay, is one of the most intelligent and fascinating creatures in Malaysia’s wildlife. These great apes, found primarily on the island of Borneo in Malaysia’s states of Sabah and Sarawak, are recognized for their remarkable cognitive abilities, distinctive reddish-brown fur, and solitary lifestyle. As a critically endangered species, the orangutan holds immense ecological, cultural, and conservation significance in Malaysia.</p>

                   <p>Orangutans are native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. In Malaysia, the <strong>Bornean orangutan</strong> <em>(Pongo pygmaeus)</em> is primarily found in Sabah and Sarawak, particularly in the dense lowland and swampy rainforests of the region. These forests provide the essential habitat for orangutans, as they rely on the tree canopy for food, shelter, and movement.

                    Orangutans are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their lives in trees. They are incredibly skilled at moving through the forest canopy using their long, powerful arms to swing from branch to branch. Their diet consists mainly of fruit, especially figs, but they also eat leaves, bark, and insects. Orangutans are known for their slow reproductive rates, with females giving birth only once every 6 to 8 years, making population recovery especially challenging.</p>

                  <h2> Historical and Cultural Significance </h2>
              </header>
              <main>
                  <!-- main -->
                   <p>In Malaysian and Bornean indigenous cultures, the orangutan has long been a symbol of the connection between humans and nature. The word "orangutan" itself comes from the Malay words “orang” (person) and “hutan” (forest), reflecting the close relationship between the species and the forest ecosystems they inhabit.

                    For many indigenous groups in Borneo, orangutans are considered sacred animals, and their presence in the forest is seen as an indicator of a healthy, balanced ecosystem. Indigenous beliefs often emphasize living in harmony with nature, and the orangutan’s place in local folklore highlights the importance of this creature not only as a part of the natural world but also as a spiritual symbol.
                    
                    In modern times, orangutans have become symbols of wildlife conservation in Malaysia. Their status as a critically endangered species highlights the urgent need for protecting the country’s rainforests from deforestation, logging, and palm oil plantation expansion. Orangutans have become ambassadors for the conservation of Malaysia’s biodiversity, with numerous organizations working to save these intelligent apes from extinction.</p>

                    <p>AnimalWiki features detailed profiles of thousands of animal species. From mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians to insects, marine life, and everything in between, each profile includes essential information such as scientific classification, physical characteristics, habitat, diet, and behavioral traits. We also cover fascinating facts that make each species unique, allowing readers to discover the intricate details of how animals survive, thrive, and adapt to their environments.

                    Beyond individual species, we explore broader topics that touch on the wonders of animal life:
                     
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Highly Intelligent:</strong> Orangutans are known for their remarkable intelligence, often considered the most intelligent of all non-human primates. They have been observed using tools, such as sticks to retrieve insects or honey, and displaying problem-solving abilities in both the wild and captivity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solitary Creatures:</strong>TUnlike other great apes such as chimpanzees or gorillas, orangutans are largely solitary animals. Adult males are particularly territorial and prefer to live alone, while females stay with their offspring until they are old enough to survive independently.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Longest Childhood in the Animal Kingdom:</strong> Orangutan offspring have one of the longest childhoods in the animal kingdom, staying with their mothers for up to 7 or 8 years. This extended period allows young orangutans to learn essential survival skills, such as foraging and navigating the forest canopy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Critically Endangered:</strong> Orangutans are critically endangered, with the population of Bornean orangutans estimated to have declined by over 50% in the last 60 years. The main threats to their survival are habitat destruction due to logging, illegal hunting, and the expansion of palm oil plantations.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Keystone Species:</strong> Orangutans play a crucial role in maintaining the health of their forest ecosystems. As frugivores, they are essential seed dispersers, helping to promote forest regeneration. Their diet of fruit means they spread seeds across the forest floor, allowing new trees to grow and supporting biodiversity.</p></li>

                <h2> Conservation Efforts </h2>
            </header>
            <main>
                <!-- main -->
                 <p>The plight of the orangutan has led to significant conservation efforts in Malaysia, focusing on habitat protection and rehabilitation. National parks and reserves, such as Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah and Semenggoh Wildlife Centre in Sarawak, provide safe havens for orphaned and injured orangutans, with programs to rehabilitate and release them back into the wild.

                    Organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation also work closely with local communities, governments, and international partners to protect orangutan habitats, prevent illegal poaching, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
