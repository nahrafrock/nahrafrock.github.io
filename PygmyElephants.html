                   <p>The Bornean pygmy elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis), the smallest subspecies of Asian elephants, is an iconic and endangered species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Borneo, particularly in the Malaysian state of Sabah. These elephants are notable for their smaller size, rounded features, and gentle temperament, making them one of the most beloved creatures in Malaysia's diverse wildlife. Despite their endearing appearance, pygmy elephants face numerous challenges, including habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, which have placed them on the endangered species list.</p>

                  <!-- main -->
                   <p>Bornean pygmy elephants are a unique subspecies of the Asian elephant, genetically distinct from their mainland relatives. They are primarily found in the lowland rainforests, river valleys, and grasslands of northeastern Borneo, with the largest populations residing in Sabah. The forests of Kinabatangan, Tabin, and the Danum Valley provide crucial habitat for these elephants.

                    Smaller in stature compared to other Asian elephants, pygmy elephants stand at about 2 to 2.5 meters tall, making them more compact than their mainland cousins. Their rounder faces, large ears, and long tails that often drag on the ground give them a more "baby-faced" appearance, contributing to their reputation as gentle giants. Despite their smaller size, pygmy elephants are highly intelligent and social animals, living in matriarchal herds led by the oldest female.</p>

                  <h2> Historical and Cultural Significance </h2>
              </header>
              <main>
                  <!-- main -->
                   <p>The Bornean pygmy elephant has been part of local folklore and cultural heritage for centuries. Indigenous communities in Sabah have long coexisted with these elephants, and they feature prominently in the myths and stories of the region. Some legends suggest that pygmy elephants are the descendants of domesticated elephants brought to Borneo by the Sultan of Sulu hundreds of years ago, although scientific evidence points to their native origin.

                    In Malaysia, the pygmy elephant holds significant ecological importance. As a keystone species, these elephants play a vital role in maintaining the balance of the rainforest ecosystems. Their movement through the forest helps to disperse seeds, open up trails, and create clearings that benefit other wildlife. The survival of this species is closely tied to the health of Sabahâ€™s forests, which makes conservation efforts crucial not just for the elephants but for the entire ecosystem.</p>

                <h2>Interesting Facts About the Pygmy Elephant </h2>
            </header>
            <main>

                    <p>AnimalWiki features detailed profiles of thousands of animal species. From mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians to insects, marine life, and everything in between, each profile includes essential information such as scientific classification, physical characteristics, habitat, diet, and behavioral traits. We also cover fascinating facts that make each species unique, allowing readers to discover the intricate details of how animals survive, thrive, and adapt to their environments.

                    Beyond individual species, we explore broader topics that touch on the wonders of animal life:
                     
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Smallest Elephants in Asia:</strong>Bornean pygmy elephants are the smallest of all Asian elephants. Adult males rarely exceed 2.5 meters in height, compared to the 3 meters or more of their mainland cousins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gentle Disposition:</strong>Pygmy elephants are known for their calm and gentle nature, which sets them apart from other elephant subspecies that can be more aggressive. This behavior has earned them a special place in the hearts of locals and tourists alike.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Endangered Status:</strong>Pygmy elephants are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). With fewer than 1,500 individuals estimated to remain in the wild, their populations are under severe threat due to habitat loss from deforestation, palm oil plantations, and logging. Fragmented habitats force these elephants into smaller areas, often leading to conflict with humans as they wander into farms and plantations in search of food.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long Tails and Big Ears:</strong>Unlike most Asian elephants, pygmy elephants have proportionally longer tails that sometimes reach the ground. Their ears are also larger relative to their body size, helping them dissipate heat in the humid tropical climate of Borneo.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Forest Engineers:</strong>Pygmy elephants play a key role as "forest engineers." By uprooting plants, breaking branches, and creating clearings, they help maintain the health and diversity of the rainforest. Their seed dispersal activities also promote new plant growth, which benefits other species in their ecosystem.</p></li>
